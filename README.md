# Amazon_Pay_Reprocess_OROs
This .NET Form desktop app is intended on helping merchants' customer service team process orders that fail. For example, when a merchant receives a decline and the order goes into a suspended state, they may not have a way to allow them to recover and retry an auth to capture funds via Seller Central. This tool will allow them to do that.
